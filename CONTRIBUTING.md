   ```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues with the CLI tool
- **Feature enhancements**: Add new functionality
- **Documentation improvements**: Enhance README, docs, or code comments
- **Performance optimizations**: Improve speed or memory usage
- **Test coverage**: Add or improve tests
- **Code quality**: Refactoring and improvements

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your contribution is already being worked on
2. **Create an issue** to discuss major changes before implementing them
3. **Keep changes focused** - one feature or bug fix per PR
4. **Follow the coding standards** outlined in this document

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Branch

Create a descriptive branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-glob-pattern-support
git checkout -b fix/memory-leak-large-files
git checkout -b docs/improve-api-documentation
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, readable code
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow the existing code style

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run code quality checks
pnpm run check

# Build the project
pnpm run build

# Test the CLI manually
node dist/index.js --help
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add support for glob patterns in file filtering

- Add glob pattern matching for include/exclude options
- Update CLI help text with glob examples
- Add tests for glob functionality"
```

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `test:` for adding tests
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `perf:` for performance improvements

### 5. Push and Submit

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
- Clear title describing the change
- Detailed description of what was changed and why
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots for UI changes (if applicable)

## Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
pnpm run dev          # Run in development mode with ts-node
pnpm run build        # Build the TypeScript project
pnpm start           # Run the built version

# Testing
pnpm test            # Run all tests
pnpm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode

# Code Quality
pnpm run lint        # Check code with Biome linter
pnpm run lint:fix    # Fix linting issues automatically
pnpm run format      # Check code formatting
pnpm run format:fix  # Fix formatting issues
pnpm run check       # Run all checks (lint + format)
pnpm run check:fix   # Fix all issues automatically

# Release (maintainers only)
pnpm run release:check    # Check if ready for release
pnpm run release:patch    # Create patch release
pnpm run release:minor    # Create minor release
pnpm run release:major    # Create major release
```

### Project Structure

```
Importy/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts     # Main entry point and core logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cli.ts       # Command-line interface
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/           # Test files
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/            # Built output (generated)
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/         # Build and release scripts
â””â”€â”€ public/          # Static assets
```

## Testing

Importy uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. We have two types of tests:

### 1. Programmatic Tests
Test the core functionality through the JavaScript API.

### 2. CLI Tests
Test the command-line interface behavior.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npx vitest run tests/programmatic.test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

When adding new features:

1. **Add unit tests** for core functionality
2. **Add integration tests** for CLI behavior
3. **Test edge cases** and error conditions
4. **Ensure good test coverage**

Example test structure:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { analyzeImports } from '../src/index.js'

describe('Import Analysis', () => {
  it('should find React imports correctly', async () => {
    const result = await analyzeImports('./test-fixtures', 'react')
    expect(result.components).toHaveProperty('useState')
  })
})
```

## Code Style

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use proper error handling with try/catch

### Code Formatting

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Check formatting and linting
pnpm run check

# Auto-fix issues
pnpm run check:fix
```

### Best Practices

- **Write readable code** with clear variable and function names
- **Add comments** for complex logic
- **Keep functions small** and focused on single responsibilities
- **Use async/await** instead of Promises.then() where possible
- **Handle errors gracefully** with meaningful error messages

## Release Process

Importy uses automated releases via GitHub Actions. The process is:

1. **Version bump**: Update version in `package.json`
2. **Automated checks**: CI runs tests and quality checks
3. **Release creation**: GitHub release is created automatically
4. **NPM publish**: Package is published to npm registry

For more details, see [Release Process](.github/RELEASE_PROCESS.md).

### For Maintainers

```bash
# Check if ready for release
pnpm run release:check

# Create releases
pnpm run release:patch    # 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1
pnpm run release:minor    # 1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0
pnpm run release:major    # 1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0
```
